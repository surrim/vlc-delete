Note: If [trash-cli](https://pypi.org/project/trash-cli/) is installed videos will be moved to the recycle bin instead of removing them directly.

# Usage

When playing a video you can click on `View` → `Remove current file from playlist and disk`. Then the video will be removed and the next one is played.

# Known bugs and issues

- There is no *fixed* shortcut key; it depends on the menu language.
  For instance in English: Press and hold `Alt`  to activate the hotkey navigation, then press `i` (`Vi̲ew`), then `r` (`R̲emove current file from playlist and disk`). I haven't found a solution to implement a fixed key; probably it's not supported by the VLC Media Player.

  - For AutoHotKey v2 and English menus, you can use the following script.

```
#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0

#HotIf WinActive("ahk_exe vlc.exe")
^Delete:: {
    Send("{Blind}{Ctrl up}{Delete up}")
    Send("{Blind}{Alt down}{i down}{i up}{r down}{r up}{Alt up}")
}
#HotIf
```

- Windows: UNC paths like `\SERVER\Share\File.mp4` are not working.
  As a workaround, you could use `net use P: "\uncpath"` in the Windows terminal and open the file with a regular path.

If you create a new issue please include your VLC Version number and operating system. Otherwise it's hard to reproduce.
The biggest help would be to contribute some Lua Code.
